Junyan received his Ph.D. degree in Data Science from City University of Hong Kong in 2025 under the supervision of [Prof. Minghua Chen](https://www.mhchen.com). He received his bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from ShanghaiTech University in 2019, mentored by [Prof. Boris Houska](http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/boris/) and [Dr. Yuning Jiang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yuning-Jiang-3). 
Junyan’s research focuses on intelligent transportation systems, particularly from the perspectives of control and optimization. He also explores computational methods for energy systems, blending theoretical insights with practical applications.
His research has been recognized with the ACM e-Energy Best Paper Award in 2023.
He is also the main developer of the [E2Pilot](https://www.e2pilots.com/) and [ParExMPC](https://github.com/sujunyan/ParExMPC/wiki) software.

<!-- I am following and working on the project: "Energy-Efficient Timely Transportation of Long-Haul Heavy-Duty Truck". Detailed descriptions and previous works can be found [here](https://www.mhchen.com/projects/trucking.html). 
From 2018 to 2019, I spent my senior year as a visiting student in the Department of EECS at UC Berkeley. 
His research interests include intelligent transportation systems, from the perspective of control and optimization. He also has broad interests in computing methods for energy systems.

### On-going project
- <a href="{{ '/projects/cfo' | relative_url }}">Follow the Sun and Go with the Wind: Carbon Footprint Optimized Timely E-Truck Transportation</a>
    - Accepted for publication in <span style="color:blue">Nature Communications</span>
    - <span style="color:blue">Best paper award</span> at ACM e-Energy 2023

<!-- - We study the carbon-optimized timely transportation for electric trucks, which is essential for maximizing the decarbonization potential of E-Trucks while challenging to solve.
    - We provide a novel problem formulation , which incurs low model complexity and reveals a useful problem structure.
